For this project, I used an Arduino Uno board, a RGB LED strip, a microphone and a button.
This project is able to detect notes from the 4th octave and change the colour of the LED strip based on the tone that it has just listened to.
When it comes to the implementation, the most important part is the usage of the Fourier transform and the Hann function.
